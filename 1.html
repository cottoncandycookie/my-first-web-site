<p style="margin-top:45px;">Steamed rice cake in an earthenware steamer was the oldest principal food for Koreans before sticky rice took over upon the invention of the iron pot.<br>
Now, there are hundreds of different kinds of Korean rice cake or tteok eaten year round. <br>
In Korea, it is customary to eat tteok guk (tteok soup) on New Year's Day and sweet tteok at weddings and on birthdays.<br>
 It is often considered a celebratory food and can range from rather elaborate versions or down to the plain-flavored tteok.<br>
Rice cakes are chosen for particular occasions depending on their color and the role they play in Korea's traditional yin-yang cosmology.</p>
